In the shadows of the great woods, on the forgotten paths of the World, gather those whom the Elves call the Galadhrim Dagnir: the Sylvan Warriors.

Formed by Rangers of Gondor, Northern Dúnedain, and Deep Forest Elves, we have forged a unique Company, at the crossroads of Martial Art, Wilderness Living, and Brotherhood.

Our Association, born from a passion for Middle-earth and carried by the breath of Legends, offers a demanding and realistic approach to the cosplay of Rangers.

The costumes, faithful to the spirit of Peter JACKSON's films and the works of J.R.R. TOLKIEN, are crafted with great care, seeking visual consistency and credibility.

But Galadhrim Dagnir is much more than just the appearance of a costume. It is a Path of Learning and Personal Achievement, a way of Exploration, a Brotherhood of the Forest.

Thus, within our Company, we teach the Art of Sword Fighting, Spear and Knife Combat, and Hand-to-Hand techniques. Also, the traditional Archery of the Ithilien Rangers (fast shooting, moving shots, high arched shots, group volleys, etc.).

All Rangers of our Company are initiated into the Secret Arts of Wilderness Survival and the Knowledge of Wild Plants (edible, medicinal, poisonous).

Building a shelter against the cold, lighting a fire at night, navigating, moving silently, fighting as a group, or tracking Orc invaders through the Art of Tracking: all these techniques you will learn at our side!

We need you to reclaim Arnor, secure Ithilien and Mirkwood, and rebuild Osgiliath and the White City.

But beware: you must first pass your Initiation. Are you ready to take up the challenge? We are waiting for you.

Our values:

Excellence and authenticity in equipment and techniques

Living transmission of ancient and practical knowledge

Sincere camaraderie and a fraternal spirit

Who better than the Galadhrim Dagnir of the 9th Company of Rangers of Gondor to make you live this Adventure, with so many disciplines at the service of a common Dream: living Middle-earth as if we were truly there!

Join the Galadhrim Dagnir, if your heart beats for the Forest, for the Kingdoms of Men, for Discovery and Adventure, if you wish to place your Blade in the Service of the Ancient Arts and your Companions of the Shadow.  
Because in the silence of the trees, we are there, invisible... watching over our People.

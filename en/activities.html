"Everything you carry, everything you do, everything you become must serve the Forest, the Fellowship, and the Dream."

Joining the ranks of the Galadhrim Dagnir is not just about putting on a costume.  
It is about wearing a Story. Walking in the footsteps of the Ithilien Rangers, the Survivors of Arnor, and the Silent Watchers of the Forests.  
It is learning to live, to fight, and to survive like them, in Harmony with Nature, in the Shadows of Trees and under the Light of the Stars.

Equipment & Outfit

We guide you in crafting your Ranger Gear, faithful to Tolkien’s Universe.

Natural materials, forest tones, functional sobriety: every part of your outfit tells a story.  
From the wooden bow to the felted hood, from the discreet dagger to the sturdy belt, we assist you in creating an immersive, credible, and coherent costume.

---

Martial Arts

Because a Ranger is a Warrior, you will learn Martial Techniques inspired by ancient traditions:

- Instinctive archery while moving, fast shooting, and high arching shots
- Sword, shield, spear, and knife combat
- Unarmed combat inspired by self-defense

All within a strict framework: safety, control, and realism, both in training and during demonstrations.

---

Survival Skills

To be a Ranger is first and foremost to survive far from the walls of cities.

By our side, you will learn how to:

- Light a fire even in the rain
- Build shelters suited to the seasons
- Read the signs of the forest to navigate and move

---

Nature Skills

Plants are our allies, our nourishment, our medicines, but also a deadly danger for those who do not know them.

You will learn to recognize edible, medicinal, and poisonous plants.

---

Tactical Arts

Finally, in the spirit of discreet patrols in Ithilien, you will learn how to:

- Camouflage yourself in the Forest
- Set up ambushes
- Move silently
- Track orcs and their allies

---

Each discipline can be practiced individually according to your affinities, or combined to fully experience the life of a Ranger. Always within your physical and mental limits.

At Galadhrim Dagnir, we do not play Rangers: we embody them as closely as possible.  
Once your training is sufficiently advanced and if you wish, we even push immersion further by patrolling in full gear in a private, secure forest — without modern equipment — faithful to the style and spirit of the Men of the West.

Join us, and discover what it truly means to live like a Guardian of the Old Forest.
